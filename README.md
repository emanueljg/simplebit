# Simplebit

A simple python program for file sharing. Inspired by [Soulseek](http://www.slsknet.org).

## Usage

1. Either install requirements OS-wide with `pip install -r requirements.txt` OR use the included [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#how-venvs-work).

2. Start the program: `pip gui.py`

3. Set your provide directory and receive directory in *Settings*.
	* The provide directory is where you put your files that you offer to other users in the channel.

	* The receive directory is where other users' files are downloaded to. If unset, defaults to OS default download directory.

4. Connect to a channel and choose a username in *Connection*.

5. Choose a user from the left-hand list you want to download files from.

6. **Double-click** the file you want to download in the right-hand list.
